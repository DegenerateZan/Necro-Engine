# Necro-Engine
Necro Engine is a visual novel/2d platform game engine written on top of raylib


######
Info : why I named it Necro Engine, 
(Not to be confused by Necrophilia (if you've a dirty minded) , and something from the YuGiOh card) 
Necro : is related to necromancer (related to resurrecting something from the death)
- originally the idea of the name is for the purpose to resurrect the Visual Novel genre popularity, because is rarely seen outside of Japan (other than DDLC) after the early 2010s
- and I make this engine for the purpose of my love towards VN genres and my hobbies of programming to hopefully will be used for the resurrection method of the genre or use it as a 2d game engine
