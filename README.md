# Necro-Engine
Necro Engine is a visual novel/2d platform game engine written on top of raylib


######
Info : why I named it Necro Engine, 
(Not to be confused by Necrophilia (if you have a dirty minded) , or something from the YuGiOh card) 

Necro : is related to a necromancer (related to resurrecting something from the death)
- originally the idea of the name came from the purpose in hope to resurrect the Visual Novel genre (dying) popularity, because is rarely seen outside of Japan (other than DDLC) after the early 2010s
- and I make this engine for the purpose of my love towards VN genres and my hobbies of programming to hopefully will be used for the resurrection method of the genre, neither use it as a 2d game engine
